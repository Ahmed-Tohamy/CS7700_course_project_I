# Multilayer Perceptron for Vehicle MPG Regression and MNIST Classification

This project implements a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch using NumPy. It is applied to two tasks:
- **Vehicle MPG Regression** using data from the UCI Machine Learning website.
- **MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification** using the MNIST dataset.

## Files in the Repository
- `mlp.py` - Core MLP implementation (forward propagation, backpropagation, activation functions).
- `train_mnist.py` - Script to train and evaluate the MLP on the MNIST dataset.
- `train_mpg_final.py` - Script to train and evaluate the MLP on the Vehicle MPG dataset.
